Birge Adventure represents turning over a new leaf as Birge grows and changes as a small leaf spirit every time he dies. Birge also turns Birge's leaf over every time Birge dies to get a new chance at life. This game is capable of solving anyone's boredom. Birge's name comes from the latin word Birch tree which represents "a new beginning". The actual source of Birge's name is derived from Hannah mishearing Andy say, "Birch" because he is ESL and cannot pronounce words properly (LMAO). Anyways... there are other elements that tie into the theme of "turning over a new leaf" such as Birge's leaf because... it is a leaf.

#Premise:
Birge is trying to reach the ground. Birge faces many obstacles that Birge must maneuver.

The leaderboard of the site is hosted as a Static site on Cloudflare Pages. This introduced a number of technical problems, each of which had a technical solution, which in turn introduced another technical problem. This continued until the snake started eating its own tail and the technical problems started becoming technical solutions.

# Lyrics to Birgalicious

Listen up, y'all, 'cause this is it
The beat that I'm bangin' is delicious
birgalicious, definition make them boys go loco
They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo
You could see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons
birgalicious (so delicious)
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that sh*t is fictitious
I blow kisses (mwah)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)
